# Image Classification using CNNs

This project, as part of the "Introduction to Computer Vision" course, explores the practical aspects of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to accurately identify plant seedlings species from a dataset comprising 12 different species.

## Project Overview

Correct identification of plant seedlings species is a significant step towards sustainable agriculture and ensuring biodiversity. This project utilizes the power of CNNs to process and classify images of plant seedlings, aiming to achieve high accuracy in identifying various species.

### Objectives

- **Data Preparation**: Organize and prepare the image data for the classification process.
- **Model Construction**: Build a Convolutional Neural Network tailored for high-resolution image classification.
- **Training**: Use the dataset to train the model, leveraging the distinctive features of the plant seedlings.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy and reliability in classifying the seedlings into one of the 12 species.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python, data manipulation, and basic machine learning concepts.
- An environment capable of running Jupyter Notebooks (Anaconda recommended).
- Necessary Python libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, SciPy, PIL, and Matplotlib.
